# Roadmap

This roadmap is a living snapshot (no dates, no promises).

## Now
- iOS node app: direct gateway WebSocket + auth, Bonjour discovery, Canvas/voice/talk support, TLS pinning (TOFU).
- Android node app: bridge transport + pairing, Canvas/Chat/Camera support.

## Next
- iOS app release hardening (build/signing/distribution, device testing).
