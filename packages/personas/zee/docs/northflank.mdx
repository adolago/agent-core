title: Deploy on Northflank
---

Deploy Zee on Northflank with a one-click template and finish setup in your browser.
This is the easiest “no terminal on the server” path: Northflank runs the Gateway for you,
and you configure everything via the `/setup` web wizard.

## How to get started

1. Click [Deploy Zee](https://northflank.com/stacks/deploy-zee) to open the template.  
2. Create an [account on Northflank](https://app.northflank.com/signup) if you don’t already have one.  
3. Click **Deploy Zee now**.  
4. Set the required environment variable: `SETUP_PASSWORD`.
5. Click **Deploy stack** to build and run the Zee template.
6. Wait for the deployment to complete, then click **View resources**.
7. Open the Zee service.
8. Open the public Zee URL and complete setup at `/setup`.
9. Open the CLI/TUI at `/zee`.

## What you get

- Hosted Zee Gateway + CLI/TUI
- Web setup wizard at `/setup` (no terminal commands)
- Persistent storage via Northflank Volume (`/data`) so config/credentials/workspace survive redeploys

## Setup flow

1) Visit `https://<your-northflank-domain>/setup` and enter your `SETUP_PASSWORD`.
2) Choose a model/auth provider and paste your key.
3) (Optional) Add Telegram/WhatsApp tokens.
4) Click **Run setup**.
5) Open the CLI/TUI at `https://<your-northflank-domain>/zee`

If Telegram DMs are set to pairing, the setup wizard can approve the pairing code.

## Getting chat tokens

### Telegram bot token

1) Message `@BotFather` in Telegram
2) Run `/newbot`
3) Copy the token (looks like `123456789:AA...`)
4) Paste it into `/setup`
