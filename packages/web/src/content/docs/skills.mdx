Agent skills let OpenCode discover reusable instructions from your repo or home directory.
The model can then call the built-in `skill` tool to load the full skill content into the conversation.

---

## Place files

A skill is a Markdown file named `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter.
OpenCode scans for `skill/**/SKILL.md` inside your config directories.

Common locations:

- Project: `.opencode/skill/<name>/SKILL.md`
- Global (recommended): `~/.config/opencode/skill/<name>/SKILL.md`
- Global (legacy): `~/.opencode/skill/<name>/SKILL.md`

Because discovery uses `skill/**/SKILL.md`, you can also organize skills into subfolders:

- `.opencode/skill/release/git-release/SKILL.md`
- `~/.config/opencode/skill/frontend/react/SKILL.md`

---

## Understand discovery

OpenCode loads config directories in this order:

- `~/.config/opencode`
- Any `.opencode` directories between your current working directory and the git worktree
- `~/.opencode`
- `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR` (if set)

For each directory, it discovers all matching `skill/**/SKILL.md` files.
If multiple skill files share the same frontmatter `name`, the last one loaded wins.

---

## Write frontmatter

At minimum, include:

- `name` (required) — the skill identifier
- `description` (required) — a short summary used for discovery

Extra frontmatter fields are allowed, but currently ignored by OpenCode.

---

## Use an example

Create `.opencode/skill/git-release/SKILL.md` like this:

```markdown
---
name: git-release
description: Create consistent releases and changelogs
---

## What I do

- Draft release notes from merged PRs
- Propose a version bump
- Provide a copy-pasteable `gh release create` command

## When to use me

Use this when you are preparing a tagged release.
Ask clarifying questions if the target versioning scheme is unclear.
```

---

## Permissions

Loading skills is controlled by `permission.skill`. For example, require approval before any skill is loaded:

```json title="opencode.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "permission": {
    "skill": "ask"
  }
}
```

You can also configure per-skill rules using wildcards:

```json title="opencode.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "permission": {
    "skill": {
      "*": "deny",
      "git-*": "allow"
    }
  }
}
```

## Recognize prompt injection

OpenCode adds an `<available_skills>` XML block to the system prompt.
Each entry includes the skill name and description.

```xml
<available_skills>
  <skill>
    <name>git-release</name>
    <description>Create consistent releases and changelogs</description>
  </skill>
</available_skills>
```

---

## Troubleshoot loading

If a skill does not show up:

- Check the file is named `SKILL.md` (all caps)
- Confirm the YAML frontmatter includes `name` and `description`
- Ensure the file lives under a `skill/` folder within a config directory (like `.opencode/` or `~/.config/opencode/`)
