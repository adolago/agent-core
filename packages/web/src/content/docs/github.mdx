description: Use Agent-Core in GitHub issues and pull-requests.
---

Agent-Core integrates with your GitHub workflow. Mention `/agent-core` or `/oc` in your comment, and Agent-Core will execute tasks within your GitHub Actions runner.

---

## Features

- **Triage issues**: Ask Agent-Core to look into an issue and explain it to you.
- **Fix and implement**: Ask Agent-Core to fix an issue or implement a feature. And it will work in a new branch and submits a PR with all the changes.
- **Secure**: Agent-Core runs inside your GitHub's runners.

---

## Installation

Run the following command in a project that is in a GitHub repo:

```bash
agent-core github install
```

This will walk you through installing the GitHub app, creating the workflow, and setting up secrets.

---

### Manual Setup

Or you can set it up manually.

1. **Install the GitHub app**

   Install the Agent-Core GitHub app available in your organization or self-hosted setup.

2. **Add the workflow**

   Add the following workflow file to `.github/workflows/agent-core.yml` in your repo. Make sure to set the appropriate `model` and required API keys in `env`.

   ```yml title=".github/workflows/agent-core.yml" {24,26}
   name: agent-core

   on:
     issue_comment:
       types: [created]
     pull_request_review_comment:
       types: [created]

   jobs:
     agent-core:
       if: |
         contains(github.event.comment.body, '/oc') ||
         contains(github.event.comment.body, '/agent-core')
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       permissions:
         id-token: write
       steps:
          - name: Checkout repository
            uses: actions/checkout@v6
            with:
              fetch-depth: 1
              persist-credentials: false

          - name: Run Agent-Core
           uses: anomalyco/agent-core/github@latest
           env:
             ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
           with:
             model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514
             # share: true
             # github_token: xxxx
   ```

3. **Store the API keys in secrets**

   In your organization or project **settings**, expand **Secrets and variables** on the left and select **Actions**. And add the required API keys.

---

## Configuration

- `model`: The model to use with Agent-Core. Takes the format of `provider/model`. This is **required**.
- `agent`: The agent to use. Must be a primary agent. Falls back to `default_agent` from config or `"build"` if not found.
- `share`: Whether to share the Agent-Core session. Defaults to **true** for public repositories.
- `prompt`: Optional custom prompt to override the default behavior. Use this to customize how Agent-Core processes requests.
- `token`: Optional GitHub access token for performing operations such as creating comments, committing changes, and opening pull requests. By default, Agent-Core uses the installation access token from the Agent-Core GitHub App, so commits, comments, and pull requests appear as coming from the app.

  Alternatively, you can use the GitHub Action runner's [built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/tutorials/authenticate-with-github_token) without installing the Agent-Core GitHub App. Just make sure to grant the required permissions in your workflow:

  ```yaml
  permissions:
    id-token: write
    contents: write
    pull-requests: write
    issues: write
  ```

  You can also use a [personal access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)(PAT) if preferred.

---

## Supported Events

Agent-Core can be triggered by the following GitHub events:

| Event Type                    | Triggered By                           | Details                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `issue_comment`               | Comment on an issue or PR              | Mention `/agent-core` or `/oc` in your comment. Agent-Core reads context and can create branches, open PRs, or reply. |
| `pull_request_review_comment` | Comment on specific code lines in a PR | Mention `/agent-core` or `/oc` while reviewing code. Agent-Core receives file path, line numbers, and diff context.   |
| `issues`                      | Issue opened or edited                 | Automatically trigger Agent-Core when issues are created or modified. Requires `prompt` input.                      |
| `pull_request`                | PR opened or updated                   | Automatically trigger Agent-Core when PRs are opened, synchronized, or reopened. Useful for automated reviews.      |
| `schedule`                    | Cron-based schedule                    | Run Agent-Core on a schedule. Requires `prompt` input. Output goes to logs and PRs (no issue to comment on).        |
| `workflow_dispatch`           | Manual trigger from GitHub UI          | Trigger Agent-Core on demand via Actions tab. Requires `prompt` input. Output goes to logs and PRs.                 |

### Schedule Example

Run Agent-Core on a schedule to perform automated tasks:

```yaml title=".github/workflows/agent-core-scheduled.yml"
name: Scheduled Agent-Core Task

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 9 * * 1" # Every Monday at 9am UTC

jobs:
  agent-core:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: write
      pull-requests: write
      issues: write
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v6
        with:
          persist-credentials: false

      - name: Run Agent-Core
        uses: anomalyco/agent-core/github@latest
        env:
          ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
        with:
          model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514
          prompt: |
            Review the codebase for any TODO comments and create a summary.
            If you find issues worth addressing, open an issue to track them.
```

For scheduled events, the `prompt` input is **required** since there's no comment to extract instructions from. Scheduled workflows run without a user context to permission-check, so the workflow must grant `contents: write` and `pull-requests: write` if you expect Agent-Core to create branches or PRs.

---

### Pull Request Example

Automatically review PRs when they are opened or updated:

```yaml title=".github/workflows/agent-core-review.yml"
name: agent-core-review

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, ready_for_review]

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: read
      pull-requests: read
      issues: read
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6
        with:
          persist-credentials: false
      - uses: anomalyco/agent-core/github@latest
        env:
          ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514
          use_github_token: true
          prompt: |
            Review this pull request:
            - Check for code quality issues
            - Look for potential bugs
            - Suggest improvements
```

For `pull_request` events, if no `prompt` is provided, Agent-Core defaults to reviewing the pull request.

---

### Issues Triage Example

Automatically triage new issues. This example filters to accounts older than 30 days to reduce spam:

```yaml title=".github/workflows/agent-core-triage.yml"
name: Issue Triage

on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]

jobs:
  triage:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: write
      pull-requests: write
      issues: write
    steps:
      - name: Check account age
        id: check
        uses: actions/github-script@v7
        with:
          script: |
            const user = await github.rest.users.getByUsername({
              username: context.payload.issue.user.login
            });
            const created = new Date(user.data.created_at);
            const days = (Date.now() - created) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24);
            return days >= 30;
          result-encoding: string

      - uses: actions/checkout@v6
        if: steps.check.outputs.result == 'true'
        with:
          persist-credentials: false

      - uses: anomalyco/agent-core/github@latest
        if: steps.check.outputs.result == 'true'
        env:
          ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
        with:
          model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514
          prompt: |
            Review this issue. If there's a clear fix or relevant docs:
            - Provide documentation links
            - Add error handling guidance for code examples
            Otherwise, do not comment.
```

For `issues` events, the `prompt` input is **required** since there's no comment to extract instructions from.

---

## Custom prompts

Override the default prompt to customize Agent-Core's behavior for your workflow.

```yaml title=".github/workflows/agent-core.yml"
- uses: anomalyco/agent-core/github@latest
  with:
    model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5
    prompt: |
      Review this pull request:
      - Check for code quality issues
      - Look for potential bugs
      - Suggest improvements
```

This is useful for enforcing specific review criteria, coding standards, or focus areas relevant to your project.

---

## Examples

Here are some examples of how you can use Agent-Core in GitHub.

- **Explain an issue**

  Add this comment in a GitHub issue.

  ```
  /agent-core explain this issue
  ```

  Agent-Core will read the entire thread, including all comments, and reply with a clear explanation.

- **Fix an issue**

  In a GitHub issue, say:

  ```
  /agent-core fix this
  ```

  And Agent-Core will create a new branch, implement the changes, and open a PR with the changes.

- **Review PRs and make changes**

  Leave the following comment on a GitHub PR.

  ```
  Delete the attachment from S3 when the note is removed /oc
  ```

  Agent-Core will implement the requested change and commit it to the same PR.

- **Review specific code lines**

  Leave a comment directly on code lines in the PR's "Files" tab. Agent-Core automatically detects the file, line numbers, and diff context to provide precise responses.

  ```
  [Comment on specific lines in Files tab]
  /oc add error handling here
  ```

  When commenting on specific lines, Agent-Core receives:
  - The exact file being reviewed
  - The specific lines of code
  - The surrounding diff context
  - Line number information

  This allows for more targeted requests without needing to specify file paths or line numbers manually.
