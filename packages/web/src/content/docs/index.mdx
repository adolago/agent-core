[**Agent-Core**](/) is an open source AI coding agent. It's available as a terminal-based interface, desktop app, or IDE extension.

Let's get started.

---

#### Prerequisites

To use Agent-Core in your terminal, you'll need:

1. A modern terminal emulator like:
   - [WezTerm](https://wezterm.org), cross-platform
   - [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org), cross-platform
   - [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org), Linux and macOS
   - [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/), Linux and macOS

2. API keys for the LLM providers you want to use.

---

## Install

The easiest way to install Agent-Core is through the install script.

```bash
curl -fsSL INSTALL_URL | bash
```

You can also install it with the following commands:

- **Using Node.js**

        <Tabs>

      <TabItem label="npm">
      ```bash
      npm install -g agent-core
      ```

          </TabItem>

        <TabItem label="Bun">
        ```bash
        bun install -g agent-core
        ```

          </TabItem>

        <TabItem label="pnpm">
        ```bash
        pnpm install -g agent-core
        ```

          </TabItem>

        <TabItem label="Yarn">
        ```bash
        yarn global add agent-core
        ```

      </TabItem>

  </Tabs>

- **Using Homebrew on macOS and Linux**

  ```bash
  brew install anomalyco/tap/agent-core
  ```

  > We recommend using the Agent-Core tap for the most up to date releases. The official `brew install agent-core` formula is maintained by the Homebrew team and is updated less frequently.

- **Using Paru on Arch Linux**

  ```bash
  paru -S agent-core-bin
  ```

#### Windows

- **Using Chocolatey**

  ```bash
  choco install agent-core
  ```

- **Using Scoop**

  ```bash
  scoop install agent-core
  ```

- **Using NPM**

  ```bash
  npm install -g agent-core
  ```

- **Using Mise**

  ```bash
  mise use -g github:anomalyco/agent-core
  ```

- **Using Docker**

  ```bash
  docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/anomalyco/agent-core
  ```

Support for installing Agent-Core on Windows using Bun is currently in progress.

You can also grab the binary from the [Releases](https://github.com/anomalyco/agent-core/releases).

## Configure

With Agent-Core you can use any LLM provider by configuring their API keys.

If you are new to using LLM providers, we recommend using [Agent-Core Zen](/docs/zen).
It's a curated list of models that have been tested and verified by the Agent-Core
team.

1. Run the `/connect` command in the TUI, select agent-core, and head to [/auth](/auth).

   ```txt
   /connect
   ```

2. Sign in, add your billing details, and copy your API key.

3. Paste your API key.

   ```txt
   ┌ API key
   │
   │
   └ enter
   ```

Alternatively, you can select one of the other providers. [Learn more](/docs/providers#directory).

---

## Initialize

Now that you've configured a provider, you can navigate to a project that
you want to work on.

```bash
cd /path/to/project
```

And run Agent-Core.

```bash
agent-core
```

Next, initialize Agent-Core for the project by running the following command.

```bash frame="none"
/init
```

This will get Agent-Core to analyze your project and create an `AGENTS.md` file in
the project root.

:::tip
You should commit your project's `AGENTS.md` file to Git.
:::

This helps Agent-Core understand the project structure and the coding patterns
used.

---

## Usage

You are now ready to use Agent-Core to work on your project. Feel free to ask it
anything!

If you are new to using an AI coding agent, here are some examples that might
help.

---

### Ask questions

You can ask Agent-Core to explain the codebase to you.

:::tip
Use the `@` key to fuzzy search for files in the project.
:::

```txt frame="none" "@packages/functions/src/api/index.ts"
How is authentication handled in @packages/functions/src/api/index.ts
```

This is helpful if there's a part of the codebase that you didn't work on.

---

### Add features

You can ask Agent-Core to add new features to your project. Though we first recommend asking it to create a plan.

1. **Create a plan**

   Agent-Core has a _Plan mode_ that disables its ability to make changes and
   instead suggest _how_ it'll implement the feature.

   Switch to it using the **Tab** key. You'll see an indicator for this in the lower right corner.

   ```bash frame="none" title="Switch to Plan mode"
   <TAB>
   ```

   Now let's describe what we want it to do.

   ```txt frame="none"
   When a user deletes a note, we'd like to flag it as deleted in the database.
   Then create a screen that shows all the recently deleted notes.
   From this screen, the user can undelete a note or permanently delete it.
   ```

   You want to give Agent-Core enough details to understand what you want. It helps
   to talk to it like you are talking to a junior developer on your team.

   :::tip
   Give Agent-Core plenty of context and examples to help it understand what you
   want.
   :::

2. **Iterate on the plan**

   Once it gives you a plan, you can give it feedback or add more details.

   ```txt frame="none"
   We'd like to design this new screen using a design I've used before.
   [Image #1] Take a look at this image and use it as a reference.
   ```

   :::tip
   Drag and drop images into the terminal to add them to the prompt.
   :::

   Agent-Core can scan any images you give it and add them to the prompt. You can
   do this by dragging and dropping an image into the terminal.

3. **Build the feature**

   Once you feel comfortable with the plan, switch back to _Build mode_ by
   hitting the **Tab** key again.

   ```bash frame="none"
   <TAB>
   ```

   And asking it to make the changes.

   ```bash frame="none"
   Sounds good! Go ahead and make the changes.
   ```

---

### Make changes

For more straightforward changes, you can ask Agent-Core to directly build it
without having to review the plan first.

```txt frame="none" "@packages/functions/src/settings.ts" "@packages/functions/src/notes.ts"
We need to add authentication to the /settings route. Take a look at how this is
handled in the /notes route in @packages/functions/src/notes.ts and implement
the same logic in @packages/functions/src/settings.ts
```

You want to make sure you provide a good amount of detail so Agent-Core makes the right
changes.

---

### Undo changes

Let's say you ask Agent-Core to make some changes.

```txt frame="none" "@packages/functions/src/api/index.ts"
Can you refactor the function in @packages/functions/src/api/index.ts?
```

But you realize that it is not what you wanted. You **can undo** the changes
using the `/undo` command.

```bash frame="none"
/undo
```

Agent-Core will now revert the changes you made and show your original message
again.

```txt frame="none" "@packages/functions/src/api/index.ts"
Can you refactor the function in @packages/functions/src/api/index.ts?
```

From here you can tweak the prompt and ask Agent-Core to try again.

:::tip
You can run `/undo` multiple times to undo multiple changes.
:::

Or you **can redo** the changes using the `/redo` command.

```bash frame="none"
/redo
```

---

## Share

The conversations that you have with Agent-Core can be [shared with your
team](/docs/share).

```bash frame="none"
/share
```

This will create a link to the current conversation and copy it to your clipboard.

:::note
Conversations are not shared by default.
:::

Here's an [example conversation](/s/4XP1fce5) with Agent-Core.

## Customize

And that's it! You are now a pro at using Agent-Core.

To make it your own, we recommend [picking a theme](/docs/themes), [customizing the keybinds](/docs/keybinds), [configuring code formatters](/docs/formatters), [creating custom commands](/docs/commands), or playing around with the [Agent-Core config](/docs/config).
