Use this tool to suggest switching to hold mode when you want to pause and review before making file alterations.

This tool will ask the user if they want to switch to hold mode.

Call this tool when:
- The user's request is complex and would benefit from planning first
- You want to research and design before making changes
- The task involves multiple files or significant architectural decisions

Do NOT call this tool:
- For simple, straightforward tasks
- When the user explicitly wants immediate implementation
- When already in hold mode
