description: Show/toggle mode status

Check and report the current mode from the UI footer:
- HOLD (research only, no edits)
- RELEASE (can edit files)

If the user says `:mode hold` - remind them to use `ctrl+h` to switch to HOLD mode.
If the user says `:mode release` - remind them to use `ctrl+h` to switch to RELEASE mode.

The mode toggle keybind is `ctrl+h`.
