Commit the current changes with a meaningful message.

Follow the commit conventions from /commit - include prefixes like:
- docs: for documentation
- tui: for TUI changes
- core: for core functionality
- ci: for CI/CD
- fix: for bug fixes
- feat: for features

Explain WHY, not WHAT. Be specific about user-facing changes.
