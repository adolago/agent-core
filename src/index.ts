/**
 * Agent Core - Unified AI Agent Foundation
 *
 * Powers Stanley (GUI/GPUI), Zee (WhatsApp/Telegram), and agent-core (CLI/TUI)
 * with subscription-based auth support (Claude Max, ChatGPT Plus, GitHub Copilot).
 *
 * ## Architecture Overview
 *
 * - **Provider System**: 15+ LLM providers with models.dev integration
 * - **Agent System**: Configurable personas, permissions, and mode switching
 * - **Tool System**: Built-in tools with MCP integration
 * - **Memory Layer**: Qdrant vector storage with semantic search
 * - **Surface Abstraction**: CLI/TUI, GUI, and Messaging adapters
 * - **Plugin System**: Hook-based extensibility
 * - **Session Management**: Streaming, retry logic, persistence
